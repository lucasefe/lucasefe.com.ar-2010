title: Three things to realize
---
Going through old notes, I got to this three lines. They are from the Last Lecture of Randy Pausch. 

Randy's conference was about many things. I started trying to take notes, but after a few minutes I stopped, and then I just got into what he was saying. No more notes. 

He's one of the few that really understood something about life. 

* Fundamentals, you have to get the fundamentals first... (applies to any kind of craft).
* Being alone while you are making lots of mistakes, is the worst place ever to be. If that happens, then something's wrong. 
* Experience is what you get when you didn't get what you wanted.
